		<p>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</p>
		<p>You are O, your friend (or the computer in this case) is X. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</p>
		<p>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</p>
		<p>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</p>
